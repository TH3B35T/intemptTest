This was the email I got:

Detailed post page (where a specific post and its comments are displayed, also post can be edited and removed) 
Create a new post page

Create a drone with HTML and CSS 
Drone should be able to fly both vertically and horizontally and wings should rotate with proper animation as well.

Add animation to the drone’s body based on logical inertia from the drone’s movement based on arrow keys.
